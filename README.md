# 3-Dimensional Graphing Calculator (using Godot)
- Developed a 3-dimensional graphing calculator that takes the equation input of the user, in the form of z=f(x,y), and graphs the corresponding 3 dimensional surface within the specified domain
- Implemented a parsing algorithm to process the equation
- Collaborated with my computer science professor for feedback and suggested
