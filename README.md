3-Dimensional Graphing Calculator
• Developed a 3D calculator that takes the equation input of the user, in the form of z=f(x,y), and graphs the corresponding 3 dimensional surface within the specified domain
• Implemented a parsing algorithm to process the equation
• Collaborated with my computer science professor for feedback and suggested
